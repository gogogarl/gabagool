# Gabagool's Pizza

There's a new pizza place in town, but they didn't budget for a website. Instead, they've hired a small team that have no experience building anything, who will learn together and get paid nothing. Welcome newcomers [Mtwarrior](https://github.com/mtwarrior), [meowmeowsar](https://github.com/meowmeowsar), and [jubejube902](https://github.com/jubejube902)!

## Client's initial request

Build a basic website with Home page, About page, Menu page, and Contact page. Client doesn't really know what information should be on a website, or how it should look, so they're letting us take the lead. A logo has been provided. Good luck and have fun!
